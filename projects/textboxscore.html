      Let's say there are a few baseball players you like. Did you know that during the summer they play baseball games pretty much every day? It's ridiculous. Lets say that you want a quick way to see what your favorite player did in his game last night. You could look up the box score of the game, or use a fantasy baseball player tracker to show you the stats of your player.

      A lot of baseball people find these numbers soothing, but there sure are a lot of them! Wouldn't it be easier if instead of seeing all the stats, you could just choose which stats you cared about, and then read a sentence like "Last night, Miguel Cabrera struck out twice and got an RBI."

      What if you could do the same thing for five different players, in five different sports! You could pretty much have your own custom sports page, delivering EXACTLY the sports news you want. Now, to be clear, doing that will require doing a lot of bullshit with APIs and other stuff I don't understand... yet. But I think we can throw together some IF ELSE Statements to create the text string to make a prototype!
      Caveats: This thing almost definitley exists somewhere else on the web already so ¯\(º_o)/¯? Also I don't know if this is actually possible.
